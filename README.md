- 👋 Hi there! This is Yuhui Chen. I am currently a third-year Ph.D student in Control Theory and Engineering at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CASIA](https://www.ia.cas.cn/)), supervised by Prof. [Dongbin Zhao](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhaodongbin?language=en) and Prof. [Haoran Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~lihaoran2023).

- 👀 My long-term goal is help building foundation models for embodied AI agent and use that to accelerate research in other fields. My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, robot learning, with a focus on foundation models (VLM/VLA) in order to develop autonomous agents that are capable of understanding the open world, learning from previous behaviors, and interacting intelligently with humans.

- 🌱 Prior to joining CASIA, I was a MCU embedded engineer at Dajiang Innovations ([DJI](https://www.dji.com/)). Before that, I earned my B.Eng. degree in Information Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology ([BIT](https://www.bit.edu.cn/)) and in Electrical Communication Engineering from Australian National University ([ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/)).
